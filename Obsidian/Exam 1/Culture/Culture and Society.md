# The Study of Culture
#### Tylor wrote:

1. The behavioral pattern of a population
2. The system of knowledge and beliefs - the standards and rules that generate and underlie behavior
Recall the given Spradley Definition: [[Defining Culture#Provided Definitions|Spradley Definition]]
	Here, Culture is not the habitual behavior itself

#### Ward H Goodenough
	Set standards for how we should think about and define culture
> "Culture is a model of what one needs to know to function acceptably as a member of that community in the same way a grammar and a dictionary of a language aim to provide a model of what one needs to know win order to speak the language acceptably"

Culture therefore is a:
- Model of reality
- Model for Behavior

*Culture is the template that tells us what we think is reality*

We have learned a set of rules for constricting individual letter that stand for sounds in a language
1. Use this knowledge to interpret behavior
2. Use this knowledge to generate or produce behavior
SO - Culture is not the letters b-a-t on the page, but the set of rules or [[Culture as a Template|Templates]] that make it up

# The Study of Society
***A society is a kind of social system that consists of people interacting in patterned ways***
we say that this is **Society X**, because it is distinct from surrounding populations or societies because:
1. Its members live in separatee communities
2. Its members speak a common language
3. Its members share the same body of customs
4. Its members interact with each other more closely and more often than with outsiders
****
#### All societies have internal organization which we refer to as **Social Structure** and **Social Organization**

****
Many anthropologists use these terms interchangeably, and we will be doing this as well
	Keep in mind that there are hundreds of pages differentiating the two

**[[Culture and Society#Ward H Goodenough|Ward H Goodenough]]** has differentiated Culture and social structure in a useful way
> "Culture is an ordered system of meaning and symbols in terms of which social interactions takes place and a social system is the pattern of social interaction itself"

#### Clifford Geertz
> "Culture and social structure are different abstractions from the same phenomena
> - Social Structure is an abstraction from the patterns of actual behavior
> - culture is the system of meaning in which it is embedded"

# Why do Cultures Change?
	Examining history reveals that cultures change over time
A lot of culture changes can be accredited to changes in the external environment, as hinted at in [[Introducing Anthropology#Class Focus on Socio-Cultural Anthropology|Environmental Impact]] 
- Inventions and discoveries, including behavior and ideas, when accepted and regularly used by a society, will change a culture.
## Innovation
	The speed at which an innovation is adpoted may depend partly on how new behaviors and ideas are typically transmitted - or taught - in society
In general, people are more likely to adopt a behavior as it becomes more common.
> [!info] Innovation
>Relatively little is known about why some people are more innovative than others. The ability to innovate may depend in part on such individual characteristics as high intelligence and creativity. Creativity may be influenced by social conditions.

New cultural elements in one society may come from another society. Innovation occurring in this way is called **Diffusion**.

>[!def] Acculturation
>Another type of change that occurs when different cultural groups come into intensive contact. Acculturation occurs primarily when one of the two societies in contact is **more powerful that the other**.

One of the most drastic ways a culture can change is through revolution, where the countries rulers are overthrown, typically in a violent manner
- Revolutions are not always successful in their goals, nor necessarily bring about culture change
- Revolutions are more likely in cultures that are just becoming industrialized

# Culture Adaptation
	freq. of a new learned behavior will increase over time and become customary in a population if the people exhibiting that behaviro are most likely to survive and reproduce
> [!info] 
> When circumstances change, individuals are more likely to try ideas or behaviors that are different from those of their parents
