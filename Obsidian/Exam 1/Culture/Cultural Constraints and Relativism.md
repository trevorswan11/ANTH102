# Constraints and Hinderances
Because members of fa culture generally conform to that culture, they are not always aware of being constrained by its standards or rules for acceptable behavior, which social scientists refer to as norms
## Hinderances on Studies
	Attitudes of a given population can hinder their ability to properly be studied or surveyed
- **Ethnocentrism:** a view of one's cultural behaviors and attitudes as correct and those of other cultures as immoral or inferior - can bias objectively observing another culture
	- also keeps a person from truly understanding their own customs
- The **Glorification** of ones culture or that of another also serves to hinder effective studies
## Cultural Relativism
	this idea rejects the notion that Western cultures are at the highest or most progressive stage in evolution
Serves to combat the hinderances described [[Cultural Constraints and Relativism#Hinderances on Studies|previously]].
- Attempts to objectively describe and understand a society's customs and ideas in the context of that society's problems and opportunities
Helps Anthropologists be alert to perspectives in other cultures that might change or challenge their own cultural beliefs
> [!note] 
> Approaches using cultural relativism pose conflicts with efforts to create universal standards of human rights. However, universal human rights advocates might increase their persuasiveness if they are aware of the viewports and values within a particular culture.
# Relativism vs. Universalism
## Universalism
Universalism argues that there are certain standards, norms, and values that are universally valid and should apply to every human bein . The goal is to induce all humans to replace aspects of their own cultural templates and adopt there universal standards.
#### This is part of the idea of universal human rights
## Cultural Relativism
- Cultural relativists, on the other hand, argue that human rights are culturally dependent and that no morals can be extended across cultures
