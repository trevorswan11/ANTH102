# What is Culture
## Provided Definitions
****
**Goldstein's Simplification:** Culture is a basic concept that refers to the shared beliefs, values, practices, norms, symbols, languages, behaviors, and material objects that characterize a particular group of people.

**James Spradley's Definition:** Culture is that acquired and shared knowledge that people use to Interpret experience and generate social behavior.
****
**Textbook Definition:** Customary ways a particular population of study thinks and behaves.
[[Culture Example]]: In the linked example, how might different cultures group the shapes
	America might, for example, organize by size, color, or shape
			*Color may be more accurate due to American Racism and its history*
		These Categories, however, are **arbitrary**, ==just like culture==
*the way different cultures categorize parts of life is arbitrary. This is important to remember*
>[!note]
>The terms 'society' and 'culture' are **not** synonymous. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to the learned and shared behaviors, ideas, and characteristic of those people.

*Behaviors can also produce products or material culture, including houses, musical instruments, and tools that are the products of customary behavior.*
[[Cultural Constraints and Relativism|Constraints]]: Can be direct and indirect, which is explored further here.
****
**Definition of Enculturation:** Also known as socialization, the complex process of conscious and unconscious learning through which older generations induce younger generations to adopt the groups culture as their own.

For all intents and purposes, Ego is used to represent the middle of a family tree being examined. *This is also means the center of a given kinship diagram*
- In America, we are taught to call both our mom and dads brother's aunts and uncles respectively
Not all cultures treat this equally
- In Tibetan, for example, call FBr and FSi their ago and ani, respectively. Their MBr and MSi are called somo and ashag. 
- The titles are not interchangeable, and it is incorrect practice to address them equally according to Tibetan culture.
#### **In Summary**
	For something to be considered cultural, it must not only be shared but also learned
- Genealogy/biology - independent of culture
		American culture - equal treatment
		Tibetan Culture - treat aunt/uncle different on either side of the family
- Culture is the acquired and shared knowledge that people use to:
1. Interpret Experience
2. Generate Social Behavior
**==Culture is ARBITRARY==**
# Extending Culture: 
[[Culture as a Template]]: Describes The way culture is viewed and described
[[Culture and Society]] and [[Cultural Constraints and Relativism|Relativism]] Reflect the impacts and purposes of cultures
