# Think of Culture as a Template
![[Pasted image 20240130121331.png]]
- The orange part is covered by the template, which in this case is the culture at hand
- Open spaces reveal parts of the world that are shared and passed down
- This template acts like culture, and there is no way to do it

## Culture is often Unconscious
	like elongating vowels as words are louder
Silly Example, but think of the yelling the word 'Dog' *experiment*
	However long you say "dog" the referent meaning does not change

> Another view is that culture is an entity, a force, that profoundly affects the individuals who live within its surface

	Relative status is implicit and overlays everything

# Describing a Culture
Understanding what is cultural involves:
	A. Separating what is shared from what is individually variable
	 B. Understanding whether common behaviors and ideas are learned
Variations in behavior are typically confined within socially acceptable limits
> [!tip] Larger Studies
> When a domain of behavior includes many individual variations or when the people studied are unaware of their pattern of behavior, the anthropologist may need to collect information from a larger sample of individuals to establish what the cultural trait is.

# Culture is Patterned
A culture that is mostly integrated is one in which elements or traits are mostly adjusted to or consistent with one another
	Integration may be influenced by psychological processes and by people transferring experiences from one area of life to another

Cultural traits may become patterned through adaptation. Customs that diminish the survival chances of a society are not likely to persist. However, what may be adaptive in one environment may not be adaptive in another.
