## Stage 1: High fertility balanced by High mortality
```ad-note
In this stage, there is vitually no concious control over either fertility or mortality with the consequence that high vital rates. Non-Equilibrium theory is exhibited where there is growth in some years and disasters and deaths in others, holding the population in homeostasis
````
**Fecundity** is the physiological ability of women to bear children
**Fertility** is the actual numbers of births that occur to an individual or population
#### The Hutteries, a group in western Canada, have the highest births per woman at 10.9, about a third of the theoretical limit of ~35.
Cultural factors reduce human childbearing. Age of entry into sexual unions and marriages, including their laws regarding divorce and remarrying
```ad-important
title: It is know that population grew **very slowly** during stage 1
```
## Stage 2: Reduction in mortality
Coupled with life expectancy increases, caused populations to grow
1. Diet: most scholars feel that the main factor in this was a general improvement in food production
	Higher Agricultural Yields
	- More effective use of traditional methods
	- expanding cultivated land
	- spread of new crops from the New World, most importantly potatoes and corn (maize)
2. Improved efficiency in trade, transportation, and storage
3. Smallpox vaccine: only came after Stage 2 was well underway
4. Sanitation and Hygiene
#### Those are generally considered the big 4 contributors
## Stage 3: Reduction in fertility starts
- Later age at first marriage
- Lower infant mortality: Stopping behavior $\to$ women had 4-5 births instead of 8-9
- Coitus Interruptus: Male pulls out
Large families became more of an economic burden than previously on the farm driven economy
## Stage 4: A New Homeostasis
DDT in England and Western Europe was the 200 year transition from HF/HM to LF/LM

# The Demographic Transition in the Rest of the World
- Increased use of advancing technology and medicine, like pesticides, antibiotics, and vaccines, help reduce mortality
```ad-info
title: It is very Hard to increase fertility, but easy to decrese mortality
```
#### Since the population was increasing so dramatically in $3^{\text{rd}}$ world countries, mortality had to be increased
- Ethically, they could not just stop providing medicine, so Family planning and contraception programs were put in place
While the third world was moving through stages 2,3 and 4 of the demographic transition, the developed world was not *really* in homeostasis yet. They were really moving to a new stage. STAGE 5
## Stage 5: Losing Population
Birth rates dropped so low that fertility became lower than mortality. This is known as ==Sub Replacement Fertility== 
#### Characterized by...
1. A very low death rate
2. A birth rate that is lower than the death rate
3. a slow decrease in the size of the population
4. population/global aging where the proportion of the elderly is increasing
```ad-theory
title: Reasons for sub-replacement fertility
- A rise in individualism
- Greater financial indepepndence of women
- An increase in non-traditional lifestyles
- less people getting married
- High cost of children and child care
```
#### Japan is a good example of this, where male and female are separated at the axis, and age increases up the shape
![[Japan Pop Pyramids]]
The elderly are taking up more and more of the population, which is called ==global aging==
