# Explanations
	an answer to a why question
In science, investigators try to achieve these two kinds of explanations:
- Associations
**Associations** usually simply state an observed relationship between two or more measured variables
- Theories
**Theories** can explain associations and usually contain a series of statements, sometimes unobservable
# Theories
## Why Theories Cannot be Proved
Although some theories may have considerable evidence supporting them, no theory can be said to be proved because many of the concepts and ideas in theories are not directly observable and therefore not directly verifiable
- The main advantage of theory as as kind of explanation is that  it may lead to new understanding or knowledge by suggesting new relationships or offering new predictions that research might support or confirm.
>[!info] Clarification
>Theories cannot be proved, but they can be rejected through a process called **falsification**. Scientists drive predictions that should be true if the theory is correct. If the predictions are not supported, then either the theory is wrong or the test of the theory is flawed

## Theoretical Approaches
	Evolutionary Theory has been a part of anthropology since Darwin and Wallace
Every social science discipline is informed by a set of theoretical orientations that give general ideas about how phenomena are to be explained.
	In anthropology, there is continual ebb and flow of orientations over time
>[!info] Evolution
>Early evolutionism postulated that culture generally develops or evolves in a uniform and progressive manner, from simpler to more complex.

Two schools of thought emerged as a reaction to the idea of cultural evolution:
- Diffusionism
	The idea that people were basically uninventive, where it was believed that new ideas and advances arose were borrowed or diffused outward to other places
- Race Theory
	Proposed that variations in human experience and in the expected levels of progress could be explained by the idea that humans belonged to different subspecies or races which had different capabilities
*This theory faded away after WWII after the Nazis used it to support the Holocaust*
- Cultural ecology eventually superseded the idea of the cultural evolution. Researchers later assumed that the physical and social environment affects the development of culture traits. Other stressed the impact of powerful state societies
**Currently, anthropologists tend to consider culture in terms of the political environment along with the physical environment**
>[!theory] Dual-Inheritance Theory
>An important contemporary idea which gives more weight to culture as part of the evolutionary process. It refers to both genes and culture playing different, but nonetheless important and interactive roles in transmitting traits to future generations

# Evidence and Testing Explanations
Researchers conduct research designed to test expectations derived from theory, which allows them to eliminate some interpretations and to accept others, at least temporarily
>[!note] Predictions
>Researchers develop an operational definition for each concept or variable mentioned in the prediction, which enables them to transform predictions into statements that can be measured and verified and enables other researchers to check and replicate results.

An investigator may take this information and use a process called sampling to decide which cases to study to see whether the predicted relationship holds.
#### Sampling Procedures
Should be designed to get a fair representation of the sampling universe of population not a biased reflection. Random sampling, as you know from statistics, increases the likelihood of getting a representative sample.
	Researchers will then use statistical evaluation to determine whether the predicted relationship exists. Probably values indicate the degree of relationships between two variables
*Replications of research with different samples lend further support or refute particular findings*
