## What is Anthropology
> [!def]
> A Discipline that studies humans, focusing on the study of differences and similarities, both biological and cultural, in human populations. Anthropology is concerned with typical biological and cultural characteristics of human populations in all periods and in all parts of the world.

## Class Focus on Socio-Cultural Anthropology
	Thinking about both diversity and Similarities/overlap of cultures and society
*If we think of the time that humans have existed as hunters and gatherers on our planet in terms of an hour, the hunting and gathering societies were the only ones on the planet for <span style="color:red">59 minutes and 40 seconds</span>, and post H-G societies, eg. agriculture and pastoralism and complex urban societies have existed for just <span style="color:red">20 seconds</span>.*
Human societies survived mostly through hunting and gathering, with no domestication or plants.
- <span style="color:red">Sometimes the environment is so influential on a society that it forces humans to adapt to it</span>
## What sets Anthro apart from other humanities?
Exploring practices:[[Anthropology's Methods]]
- Traditionally, Anth focuses on **non-western** regions, so studies are conducted outside of America and Europe.
	Most effective at answering what its like to be human
- To understand what its truly like to be an American, one must understand the rest of the world
	Anth can study major regions and draw connections btwn areas of unity and diversity
- Seeing how Less Developed Countries (LDCs) are in terms of percentage inspires us to see what they're doing differently to achieve goals we haven't met yet, like the issue of population growth decline
- Anth is holistic and also biocultural
> [!note] 
> Holistic refers to an approach that studies many aspects of a multifaceted system
- Anth is based on ethnographic research and long term fieldwork
Research must be designed and approved: [[Anthropology's Methods#Research Laws|Laws]]
#### Anthropology is **Comparative** and **Diachronic**
- **==Diachronic studies==** examine how something has developed or changed *over time*, not currently.
	- Longitudinal
- ==**Synchronic studies**== compare *current data* to other similar populations or groups
	- Cross-sectional

#### Curiosity
Anthropologists tend to focus on the *typical* characteristics of the human population they study rather than on individual variation or variation in small groups.
#### Interested in the ==EMIC Perspective==
	How Natives being studied see the world themselves
*If you cannot understand how people see the world, you cannot properly influence their decisions*
