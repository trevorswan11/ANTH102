## Demographic Transition
The paradigm that illustrates one of the most important processes of change that has affected and still is affecting the modern world. It concerns the historical shift that started around 1750 in Europe
>[!theory] What is the DDT
>The change in societies from high birth rates being balanced with high death rates towards higher birth rates with lower death rates to a final transition between low birth rates and low death rates.
#### Today, many countries are experiencing less than replacement level fertility, or sub-replacement level fertility
	We often talk about the issue of poverty growing among societies and how we are attempting to eliminate poverty, we often overlook the issue of the number of people we are adding to the world's population each and every year. We really should be examining this becuase population plays such a big role in the goal of reducing poverty.
#### Struggles
1. Population/over-population is silent; Becomes an invisible threat
	The media shows a lot of heart wrenching images and stories but fails to capture the whole picture
1. Persistent Growth, even in it modest, produces large increases over short periods
	This is due to the impact of **Doubling Time**: which is defined as the amount of time it takes for something to double
>[!def] Calculating Doubling Times
>This is calculated by the mathematical formula $70$ divided by the % of increase.
3. The Sudden Effect of Exponential Growth
	Population growth doesn't seem too troublesome until its too late
>[!example] Guppies
>A fish tank that has been set up with 2 guppies that has a carrying capacity of 100 guppies. The guppies reproduce (double) in number in every month. It takes only 9 months to break carrying capacity.
>- at 6 months, you're only at 128 fish which doesn't seem like a lot, but then 3 months later you're over carrying capacity
4. Later is Worse
	By 2008, the growth rate in India had dropped, but the number of people added per year had doubled
5. Population Momentum (aka lag effect or breaking time)
	- **Replacement Level Fertility (RLF):** The average number of children per woman at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next, excluding migration. The rate is *roughly 2.1* children for women in most countries.
	- However, despite having achieved RLF, less developed countries will continue to increase for about 30 years and could increase as much as 60% before reaching **Zero population growth (ZPG)**
````ad-example 
title: Population Momentum
#### Suppose we have Initial population in 1950 $I_{1950}$
	Below is called the age-sex Pyramid as it would look like a pyramid if graphed
| Age | Population |
| ---- | ---- |
| 50+ | 50 |
| 30-49 | 450 |
| 15-29 | 1000 |
| 0-14 | 3000 |
	Total Population in 1950 is 4500
#### Then in 1975 we have the population $I_{1975}$
| Age | Population |
| ---- | ---- |
| 50+ | 450 |
| 30-49 | 1000 |
| 15-29 | 3000 |
| 0-14 | 3000 |
	Total population in 1975 is 7450
#### Then in 2000 we have the population $I_{2000}$
| Age | Population |
| ---- | ---- |
| 50+ | 1000 |
| 30-49 | 3000 |
| 15-29 | 3000 |
| 0-14 | 3000 |
	Total population in 2000 is 10000
#### This trend, when graphed, can be represented by the transition of:

## Important Concept: RPF does not stop population growth because of population momentum

**Global Aging:** The proportion of larger of elderly gets larger and larger. This is *not* the number of elderly, but the proportion compared to the rest of the population.

#### When the elderly population grows too large and its proportion is too big, it creates a relationship that looks like this:

**This is not a Theory, this a rough but precise depiction of the growth of the world's population**
## Suppose Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden...
1. If they reproduced at a 2% growth rate/year how many doublings
	There would be about 28,000 doublings $-$  and remember that 64 doublings produced 10 quintillion
2. How many doublings would it have Adam and Eve to reach 7.8 billion (today's population)
	It would only take 30 doublings
3. How long would 30 doublings take at 2%
	- The population would double every 35 years, so it would have only taken 1050 years
	- At 0.6%, the US growth rate, the population doubles only every 177 years, so it would still only take 3510 years
#### The population growth experienced was unprecedented going off of the bibles beginnings of the world
# Implications
There are about 84 million people being added to the worlds population every year. Over 80 million in LDCs
- If we would like for each new infant to be seen by a health provider 2x a year and if each provider can see 30 infants a day and works overtime, can see about 9400 infants once a year or 47-- infants twice a year
This means we would need to hire 17,000 health providers around the globe to make this happen
## Growth Rates are Important in another way
For context Africa's population growth is massive with a 2.6% growth rate.
- By 2100, this means African population will take up about 40% of the world's total 
- If we want to concentrate on improving healthcare for Africans, the problem is vastly complicated because of the high growth rate
