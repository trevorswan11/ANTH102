**Anthropology has developed a set of methods, the most important of which are long term fieldwork participant observation**

## Research Laws
Today, research must secure approval form Institutional Research boards, or IRBs, for short
In Humanities, the definition of research can be a little loose and ambiguous:
	**Defined as:** A systemic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge
Projects will require IRB review if they require **both** research and human subjects

## Bronislaw Malinowski 
	Developed modern Anthropology fieldwork practices
His work solidified Anthropologies focus on firsthand fieldwork
*Argued that Anthropologists should **fully** immerse themselves in the culture being studied, **not** with secondhand studies*
	This led to researchers conducting studies by actually learned the native language
## Today's Methods
1. ==Fieldwork== - participant observation ("the field" can be almost any setting) 
	Done by going in and immersing yourself into the culture to get the **emic** understanding
>[!info] on Fieldwork...
*Used as a Natural experiment or laboratory*
Fieldwork is often used as a rough functional equivalent of lab work in that a fieldwork study can be used to test some hypothesis
1. ==Participant Observation== - This is the main research method used in Anthropology
	Done by embedding themselves in the life and customs of the group in order to understand the social and cultural system
3. ==Language== - A characteristic of anthropological field studies and methods is that the researcher is supposed to learn the language of he people they are studying and work through the native language
	This build trust/rapport
	Knowledge of the language allows you to talk informally and casually
	Keys to cultural categories embedded in the language
	Use of Translators can lead to errors
4. ==Qualitative Interviewing==
	**Qualitative data are data about numeric values or variables
	Quantitative data are data that can be expressed as descriptions, feelings, and experiences**
	- Socio cultural anthro uses qualitative data primarily, as you cannot accurately count the number of households or families that are in a given culture
	- Interviews are conducted in an 'Open-ended' question
		- Open ended questions are questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes/no question
	*In Fieldwork, there is extensive qualitative interviewing, which is typically **in depth** and **Open Ended***
	Informal interviews are favored, as the interviewee feels more relaxed and comfortable answering questions
	- **Key Respondents** and **Key Informant Interviews** are used in qualitative interviewing
		these are local people who have a deeper knowledge about the topic
	- Some Anthropologists also use **Surveys** or **Questionnaires**
		The collection of information from a sample of individuals through their responses to questions
	**Surveys are NOT a major method in Anthropology ${\rightarrow}$ they are mainly a secondary method**
	***Not everyone is asked the same questions, if something comes up, it might be asked about if its relevant. There Doesn't necessarily need to be a script, and you can't just shy away when the conversation shifts towards small-talk***
	- Goldstein, for example, interviewed the headman of the village, but he would also branch out from that and cross reference those answers with the rest of the village
	**Oral History** or **Life History Interviews** are another important part of interview
