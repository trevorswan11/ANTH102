Sections in textbook along with the readings in Canvas will give a broader perspective on the problematic and negative aspects of development
# Mechanisms of Change
- **Innovation:** Any new practice, food or principle that gains widespread acceptance within a group
	- **Unconscious Innovation =** Innovations that occur by chance
	- **Intentional Innovation =** Discoveries that occur by deliberate application of known techniques. The latter correspond most closely to Western Culture's model of change as predictable and determined, while the former involves accidents of one sort or another
- **Diffusion:** Borrowing of cultural elements from one society by members of another
	- **Direct Contact Diffusion:** Customs or elements of one culture are adopted by members of a neighboring culture who are in contact
		Think of the Tibetan nomad in 1988 to him riding a motorbike in 2005. Just because the culture is changing doesn't mean its getting lost!
	- **Intermediate or Indirect Diffusion:** Occurs when traits are passed from one culture to another culture through a middleman or a third party such as a trader or soldiers
	- **Stimulus Diffusion:** Occurs when an idea spreads to another culture or region and is then altered or changed in order to apart to the culture. 
		An example of this might be Chinese Porcelain
	- **Forced Diffusion:** Occurs when someone makes you take up traits of another culture
		An example of this is forcing Native American children to only speak English in school, or forcing locals in Barcelona to study only Spanish in school instead of their native Catalan Language.

>One needs to keep in mind that contact or exposure doesn't always mean Forcing the culture on the population.
#### Acculturation is a special kind of Diffusion that involves the transfer of values and customs from one dominant group to another subordinate group which results in an increased similarity between the two cultures. When the influence is overwhelmingly one way, from more powerful to the subordinate, we use the term Acculturation rather than diffusion.
	This term can be used for both individuals and societies.
>[!def] Assimilation
>The absorption and integration of people, ideas, or culture into a wider society or culture.
>*or* the process of taking in and fully understanding information or ideas.
- **Colonialism:**
- **Modernization:** A transition from a pre-modern or traditional way of life to a modern society 
	This meant the transformation from a conservative, rural, agrarian society to a secular, urban, industrial one.
		This is typically the result of imperialism or colonialism
#### There are 4 subclasses of Modernization
Modernization shifts cultures differently
	**Technological Development**
	**Farming/Agricultural Development**
	**Industrialization**
	**Urbanization**
- **International Development:** Where western countries go to non western countries to try and change aspects of their life that they don't seem to be productive to a good society
	- More Developed $\to$ Less Developed Countries.
		The USAID and Swiss Agency do a lot of these International Development tasks
	Development projects in Anthropology tend to fail or not be more successful because they are not following the EMIC perspective. It is often not the case that the target populations are in favor of the forceful changes which leads to conflict that could be avoided simply by putting themselves in the lives and immersing themselves of the societies being studied.
- **Globalization:** The growing independence of the worlds economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by the cross-border trade in good and services, technology, and flows in investment, people, ideas, and information
>[!def] Textbook Definition
>The massive flow of goods people. info, and capital across huge areas of the earth's surface
