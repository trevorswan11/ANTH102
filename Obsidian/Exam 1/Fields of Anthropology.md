## A Diagram of Fields

*the three classes in blue make up cultural anthropology, while the green is labeled itself*
>[!def]
>Applied, or practicing, anthropology is the branch of anthropology that concerns itself with applying anthropological knowledge to achieve practical goals.

# Subclasses of Anth
With the Growth of knowledge and topics available to study, Anthropologists must select specific disciplines to study in order to advance in their field.
>[!info]
>The two main groups are biological (or physical) anthropology and cultural anthropology. **Cultural Anthropology** will be more heavily investigated this semester.
#### Biological Anth
The study of humans as biological organisms, dealing with the emergence and evolution of humans and with contemporary biological variations among human populations
## Classifying Subfields
Archeology, linguistics, and ethnology compose of cultural Anthropology's subfields
> [!not] on Ethnology...
> The study of recent cultures, is now usually referred to by the parent name 'cultural anthropology'

# Biological Anthropology
	seeks to answer two distinct sets of questions
**Human Paleontology** (paleoanthropology) poses questions about the emergence of humans and their later evolution.
	A focus on human variation includes questions about how and why contemporary human populations vary biologically
- They might search for fossils to compare findings across time periods
- They might compare geological information such as climates, environments, and wildlife populations (including plants) to clarify evolutionary relationships
- Also, these researchers will look into the behavior and evolution between us and our closest related mammals
**The second major focus is why contemporary populations differ in biological characteristics**
	Why do people in different parts of the world act, look, speak, and present themselves differently
# Cultural Anthropology
	the study of how and why cultures in the past and present vary or are similar
Very heavily focused on [[Defining Culture|Culture]]. Broken into subgroups. Main aspects broken down in other notes
## **Archaeology**
	the study of past cultures primarily through their material remains
>[!def] Archaeology
>The branch of Anth that seeks to reconstruct the daily life of people who lived in the past and to trace and explain cultural changes. Often lacked written records for study, archaeologists must try to reconstruct history from the material remains of human cultures

Most deal with prehistory - the time before written records
## Linguistics
	The anthropological study of languages
Study changes that have occurred over time. 
- Historical linguistics is the study of how languages change over time and how they may relate
- Descriptive or structural linguistics is the study of how contemporary languages differ, especially in their construction
## Ethnology
	commonly called cultural anthropology
Seeks to understand how and why peoples today and in the recent past differ or are similar in their customary ways of thinking and acting
#### Ethnographer
	A type of ethnologist
Typically spends a year or so living with, interviewing, and observing the people being studied
>[!def] Ethnography
>A description of a society's customary behaviors and ideas
#### Ethnohistorian
	Combat the extensive and rapid changes experienced in the recent past
Study how the way of life of a culture has changed over time.
- Examine written documents, reports by traders, and government records
- Often must piece together and make sense of widely scattered and even apparently *contradictory* information
#### Cross-Cultural Researcher
	may be a cultural anthropologist or some other type of scientist
They work to discover general patterns across cultures like:
- What characteristics are universal
- Which traits vary and why
- What the consequences to variability are
# Applied Anthropology
	A field explicitly intended to make anthropology more useful
Typically employed in colleges, universities, and museums
- Because of the rapidly increasing speed of globalization, the field has expanded into non-western countries
# Specialization & Relevance
	Specialization is necessary in a growing field, and it furthers the development of field
> [!example] Medical Anthropology
> This field, for example, studies the central and biological contexts of human health and illness

Anthropology is obviously relevant because it helps us avoid misunderstandings between peoples
- If we can understand what makes groups different from us, we have less reason to condemn them for behavior that *appears* strange to us
**As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and globalized, the importance of understanding and trying to respect cultural and physical differences becomes more and more important**
