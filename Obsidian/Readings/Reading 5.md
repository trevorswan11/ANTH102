What the fuck was that opening, why was the wife fucking sheep? Who the fuck knows! Not me!!!

## Spread them diseases boy
Throughout history, diseases have been spread from humans to animals, and there are rarely a big issue.
*Similar observations have been made between Europeans and Animals as well*
	Unfortunately for us, the microbes we hate are a result of natural selection blah blah blah
**MYLASTCOMMITWAS4HOURSAGOWHYAMIDOINGTHISTOMYSELFRAHHHH**
	hahahahaha so funny microbes wanna spread themselves everywhere (woah) but they end up killing us in the end oopsie poops
#### We and our pathogens are now locked in an escalating evolutionary contest, with the death of one contestant the price of defeat, and with natural selection playing the role of the umpire.
	Im not writing down how our bodies fight off diseases, if thats on the exam im leaving 
## Aspects of Epidemics (i guess)
1. They spread quickly and efficiently from an infected person to a healthy person
	This results in a large percentage of the population getting diseased
2. They're acute illnesses that take effect within a short time, meaning it doesn't take long for you to either die or recover completely
3. Fortunate ones who recover develop antibodies that can last forever potentially
4. The disease tends to stick to humans, with the bugs that caused them living in the soil or on other animals
```ad-example
#### Example 1: Measles
It only took about 3 months for the whole Faerous population to either die out completely or recover.
#### Example 2: Rebulla
Occasional spreading of the diseases in many differnt epidemics across Australia. Was airborn.
```
What's true about both of these is that they require a sufficient population to actually reach the epidemic stage
	That is to say these Crowd diseases could not well sustain themselves in small societies, but they are still possible through small microbes in soil
The diseases that characteristically attack small and isolated populations can be traced back to millions of years ago, as they had to evolve all the through the evolution of the human species in order to remain potent
```ad-note
The explosive increase in world travel by Americans and in immigration to the US is turning the US into a melting pot that is bringing diseases that we couldnt have ever dreamed of to us.
```
*This feels like a weird statement and I don't really like it*
#### Some populations make it very easy for naughty diseases to spread because of poor sanitation.
## Evolution of our major diseases
1. We pick up animal borne microbes that are in their early evolutionary stages
2. The former animal pathogen evolves to a point where it can get transmitted directly between people, causing epidemics
3. The former animal borne pathogen establishes itself as a human pathogen until they die out, if ever
4. The disease now becomes a major long established epidemic disease confined to humans
#### In the century or two following Columbus's arrival in the New World, the Indian (Native American but this fucking author) population declined by about 95%. The main killers were germs as you learned in 5th grade history.
	There are more than enough examples of this on page 8 of the reading, they are omitted hre bc Im lazy
```ad-summary
title: In Summary...
The rapid spread of disease can be attribvuted to the growth of the population coupled withe changes in ways of life and customs. With increasing globalization, which is roughly defined as the spread of goods and peoples across the globe.
