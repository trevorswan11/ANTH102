# The Price of Progress - Bodley
This article attempts to argue that beliefs of progress are often both illusory and detrimental to tribal peoples that have not been able to take control of their own lives.
## Progress and the Quality of Life
*Standard of Living* is often recognized as the best measure of progress. Factors such as GNP, per capita income, capital formation, employment rates, literacy, formal education, etc. do not accurately survey that *quality* of life in a population.
```ad-theory
title: A more Useful Measure
According to these less ethnocentric criteria, the important question to ask is: Does progress or economic development increase or decrease given culture's abilioty to satisfy the physical and psychological needs of its popuilation or its stability.
```
This question is far more direct in answering the question of *quality of life*.
	Careful examination of data regarding tribal peoples shows that their standard of living is *lowered*, not raised, nu economic progress
#### Hughes & Hunter Said...
>Perhaps it would be useful for public healthy specialists to start talking about a new category of diseases called the "diseases of development" and would consist of those pathological condition which are based on the usually unanticipated consequences of the implementation of developmental schemes.
###### It can be observed that the more the islander takes on the ways of the west, the more they fall victim to the common diseases of western society
**Urbanization** is a prime measure of development but it is a mixed blessing for tribal peoples. This is due to worse health standards in Urban areas compared to rural areas.
# Dietary Change
Tribal people have always adapted to the available resources for food, regardless of how silly or bizarre they might be.
```ad-summary
title: Overall effect of dietary changes
The available data seem to indicate that the dietary changes that are linked to involvement in the eceonomy have led to worse nutritional levels in tribal peoples. Almost any deterioration can be chalked up to difficiency diseases.

- Tribal people have long been associated with incredible physique. Their teeth are no different, and changing their diet changes both of these for the worse

```ad-example

>Their modernization was demonstrated nopt onlt by the high incidence of dental caries but also the fact that 90 percent of adults and 100 percent of children had abnormalities of the dental arches.
```
## Malnutrition
	particularly protein deficiency
This has long been an issue for tribal peoples who must adopt to new economic and agricultural tactics.
```ad-info
An often overlooked aspect of malnutrition is its effect on the brain, specifically brain development.
```
The main idea here is that the generalization of customs and dietary practices lead to all around negatives for the tribal peoples.
# Ecocide
Economic development also forces Ecocide on people who once lived off of the environment.
*The main issues associated with economic development and population growth have only been brough to light as of the 1970s*
# In Summary
```ad-theory
title: Deprivation and Discrimination
Conatct with European Culture has given tribal peoples a knowledge of great wealth, opportunity, and privilege, but only very limited ways to acquire them.
```
Tribal peoples feel deprivation not only when the economic goals they have been encouraged to seek fail to come to being, but also when they discover they are powerless second class citizens. The mass effects of this can be seen on the last page of this reading.
