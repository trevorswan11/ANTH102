# Ruined - Marshall
Mycenean Ancient Greece's collapse can be chalked up to the change in climate, which still has an effect on the world today
*It seems that large changes in climate have, time and time again, caused large issues in the societies being observed, with worse effects corresponding to worse handling of the changes*
```ad-example
Sargon, which is now Syria, was hit with amssive drought that led to an immense famine.
```
#### Major Climate changes have long been associated with the ultimate ends of major civilizations.
There has, despite large amounts of evidence, always been backlash of people claiming that climates did not alter the fate of these civilizations.
## Climate's Effect
- Not related to the character of those in the society, just what they can and can not do based on the current climate. An example of this is a drought that decreases crop amounts which leads to less overall food leading to a population loss.
- People of the civilization may become more hungry leading to a thinner and weaker build that is less able to defend against well-fed hostiles
- There are, on average, more wars when the temperature is lower. These colder temperatures also resulted in more deaths and declines in population
```ad-theory
Some people dont believe the climate was really behind the vast population changes. They often quote the Aztecs withstanding a large drought, or food and prodcution prioces going up leading to epidemics due to hunger and a decline in population. They also might quote the fact that high food prices often lead to social unrest and even wars or revolutions
```
# In Summary
- While more and more studies reveal the impact of climate in the past, there will be more and more debates on how much of an effect it played in these changes.
- If we chose to believe that there is no real impact of climate change on the worlds populations, then we have everything to lose if things take a turn for the worse. On the other hand, if we assume that climate has a significant role in our well being as a society, we can better equip ourselves for dramatic change and even prevent them from happening before its too late
*This is a **classic** climate change debate*
