# Shakespeare in the Bush - Bohannan
- First impressions - believed that with the immense amount of ceremonies that would take place, that the elders would not freely participate in them. 
	This was not the case, as the elders only stopped having such high involvement in ceremonies when it became difficult to traverse the land. **Swamps rising = lessening activity frequency**
- Heavy focus on liquor "One doe snot discuss serious matters when there is beer involved"
- Old man in the village only familiar with 4 kinds of paper, which he used to criticize Bohannan for reading Hamlet in her hut so frequently:
	1. Tax receipts
	2. Bride price receipts
	3. Court fee receipts
	4. Letters
- He doesn't want them to think Hamlet is just one of their mundane papers, and he cant have them thinking he's reading or possibly manipulating papers that would be sent to a potentially illiterate person in another land so he explains Hamlet to them
	- when he protests, they threaten him with not telling anymore stories, which he doesn't want because that is a main part of anthropological fieldwork
- The elders of the village are comparing Hamlet to their village customs
	- Comparing marriage customs, including how the chiefs in the village have many wives to brew beer and prepare large meals but in Europe, the chief has one wife with paid or unpaid servants
	- This tribe does not believe in ghosts or an afterlife, so the ghost of Hamlet's father is constantly seen as a visiting omen, despite Bohannan reassuring them that the image is NOT an omen
	- Hamlets madness as they perceived had to be a result of witchcraft of vision of the beings that lurk in the forest
	- The idea of revenge was also compared, specifically who can exact revenge in familial relationships
	- They are convinced that the elders of where Bohannan is from have never truly explained what the story means, with its many ties to witchcraft
Bohannan went from having a very firm understanding of what Hamlet was meant to be about and what its message is, but after explaining thew story to the elders, she couldn't help but have a new outlook on the story. Bohannan hoped to get an insightful reaction out of the Tiv, but really got one where they asked her to tell them more stories so that they, as elders, can explain the stories true meaning
