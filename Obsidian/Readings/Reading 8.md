# Being Indigenous in the $21^{st}$ century - Mankiller
## Common Experiences
- Large diversity among communities of Indigenous Peoples around the world, each with their own distinct culture.
- Indigenous people are constantly reminded of their effect on their environment. They remain close to their land both physically and emotionally
- Sense of responsibility for one another, as cooperation has always been necessary for their survival
```ad-info
The self help movement taps into the Cherokee value of cooperation for the sake of the common good.
```
- Bound by the common experience of all being 'discovered' and subjected to colonialist forces as a result of their discovery
	Most basic human rights for Indigenous people were often discarded, leading to the subjection of policies that were designed to dispose of them, their land, and their culture through assimilation
*It is important to remember that the root issue of so many policies can be traced back to colonialism*
- Lack of education of the general public leads to the enforcement of policies that wouldn't be otherwise enforced
- Indigenous must frame their own issues, because if they don't, no one is going to advocate for them in a productive way such that government right past and current wrongs
- Many Tribal Governments in the US have their own sovereign rights with judicial systems, police, schools, and more
- Indigenous are not all the same, though it is a common misconception
# In summary
One of the great challenges for Indigenous peoples in the 21st  century will be to develop practical models to capture, maintain, and pass on traditional knowledge systems and values to future generations.
```ad-summary
Nothing can replace the sense of continuity that a general understanding of tribal knowledge brings.

It is important, for the success of Indigenous peoples in the long run, for governments to realize that Indigenous peoples do better when they have control over their own lives and destiny
