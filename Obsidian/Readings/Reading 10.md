# Population Seven Billion - Kunzig
This is heavily related to the topic [[Population|population]] presented in class lectures
# Later is Worser
- Two centuries after the population was declared to not soar again, that's exactly what it did. Advances in agriculture and sanitation in cities lead to increasing population as mortality rates dropped.
	Included vaccines, antibiotics, crop enhancement, and sewage systems that ushered waste from civilization's drinking water
- Replacement fertility in the developing world is higher because by the time the birthrate settles to the replacement fertility rate and balances with the death rate, population explodes
#### When Child Mortality declines, couples eventually have fewer children - but that transition takes a generation
	Demographers call this evolution the demographic transition
```ad-def 
title: The Demographic Dividend
A blissful few decades after the baby bopom when the boomers swelled the labor force and the number of young and old dependents became relatively small.
```
This effect is counteracted when the boomers start to retire
#### With this current generation moving towards standard childbearing age, the question arises is the population can be saved. The answer is no.
```ad-note
title: China
Since China has laws against how many children families can have, specifically its one-child policy, they are alwready below replacement fertility.
```
- In India, the main form of birth control is sterilization where there are many procedures performed on women to reduce birth rates. Once, they even tried to push vasectomies, but both male and female procedures were met with mass criticism.
>The goal in India should not be reducing fertility or population, the goal should be to make the villages more livable
#### The Population Association of America (PAA) is one of the premier gathering of the world gatherings
	Populations of individual cities are rising too highh which makes the cities lack of plans for increasing water and sanitation problems an increasing issue.

# What Matters More?
The Number of people does matter, but their consumption of resources matters a whole lot more.
```ad-summary
It's too late to keep the next middle class from being born, but its not too late to change their usage of resources.
```
Growing population impacts many other aspects of life, and the increases need for goods leads to more factory production which plays a large role in global warming , further lessening the time we have to get out shit together.
